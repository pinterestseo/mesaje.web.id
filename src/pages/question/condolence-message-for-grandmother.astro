<p>The art of offering condolences lies in authenticity. Avoid clichés and focus on expressing your genuine feelings.  Whether you knew the grandmother well or only met her briefly, a thoughtful message can bring comfort.  Simple expressions of sympathy, coupled with memories shared, can be more meaningful than lengthy, formal statements.  Choosing the right way to deliver your message, whether through a handwritten note, email, or card, is just as important as the words themselves.</p>
